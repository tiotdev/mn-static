# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Repository Overview

This is a static website archive for Mäusenews.de (a German website about gerbils/Rennmäuse). The repository contains exported WordPress content that has been converted to static HTML files, along with photo galleries generated by jAlbum software.

## Content Structure

### Main Site Files
- `index.html` - Main landing page with navigation, content sections, and Bootstrap-based layout
- `404.html` - Custom 404 error page (contains PHP template tags that suggest incomplete conversion)
- `google6b83bf090cf01786.html` - Google Search Console verification file

### Photo Galleries (`rennmausfotos_videos/fotos/`)
The photo galleries are organized into numbered albums:
- Multiple "Freilauf" (free-roaming) albums numbered 5-32
- Special albums: `erstebilder`, `bestebilder`, `labyrinth`, `terrarium`, `topolino`, `Fussballfreilauf`
- Each album contains:
  - `album/` directory with generated HTML pages
  - JAlbum metadata files: `jalbum-settings.jap`, `albumfiles.txt`, `meta.properties`, `comments.properties`
  - `res/` directory with CSS (common.css, styles.css, ie6fix.css) and JavaScript (jQuery, swfobject, skin.js)

### WordPress Cache
- `wp-content/cache/minify/` - Minified CSS and JavaScript bundles from the original WordPress site
- These files reference WordPress plugins and themes that are no longer present

## Technology Stack

- **Frontend Framework**: Bootstrap 3.3.7
- **JavaScript Libraries**: jQuery 1.11.1 and 2.1.3
- **Photo Gallery**: jAlbum (desktop application for creating web photo albums)
- **Original CMS**: WordPress 5.4.2 (not present in this static export)
- **Analytics**: Matomo/Piwik analytics (stats.tiot.de)
- **Ads**: Google AdSense integration

## Language

All content is in German (de-DE locale). The site focuses on gerbil care, DIY projects, photos, and entertainment content for gerbil enthusiasts.

## Important Constraints

### Static-Only Content
This is a static HTML archive with no backend functionality. The following features are non-functional:
- WordPress admin functionality
- Search functionality (search forms present but non-functional)
- Comment systems
- Dynamic content loading
- Cookie notices and consent management

### Mixed Conversion State
The `404.html` file contains PHP template tags (`<?php dynamic_sidebar(...) ?>`) indicating an incomplete WordPress-to-static conversion. This file would not work properly on a static hosting platform.

## Site Structure

The main navigation includes:
- **Rennmaus-Ratgeber** (Gerbil Guide) - Care information
- **Bauanleitungen** (Building Instructions) - DIY projects
- **Fotos und Videos** - Photo albums and videos
- **Specials** - Themed content (Halloween, Christmas, Games, etc.)

## Working with This Repository

### Viewing the Site
Simply open `index.html` in a web browser. The site uses CDN-hosted libraries (Bootstrap, jQuery) so it should render correctly.

### Modifying Content
- Main page content is in `index.html`
- Navigation menu is hardcoded in the HTML navbar structure
- Photo galleries should not be manually edited - they're generated by jAlbum

### External Dependencies
The site relies on several external resources:
- Bootstrap CSS/JS from MaxCDN
- jQuery from Google's CDN
- Font Awesome icons
- Google Analytics and AdSense scripts
- Matomo/Piwik analytics at stats.tiot.de

### Hosting Considerations
This site is designed for static hosting but has some cleanup needed:
- Remove or convert PHP template tags in 404.html
- Consider removing WordPress-specific references
- Update or remove tracking scripts as needed
